  NEURAL NETWORK- overfitting problem



we will learn HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR NEURAL NETWORK:

problem: 1.Hyper parameter tuning -*we will use right amount of Hidden layers. *no of nodes in right pattern/shape *activation function changing method *loss function changing method *Optimizer *batch size *no of epochs *Learning rate

2.Vanishing Gradient //Eploding-(in back propagation)

*Optimizer change *Initialization weigth change method *Batch normalization

3.Data creation- *transfer learning

4.Slow training- 5.Overfitting- *L1 & L2 regularizatiion, *Early Stopping *Batch normalization
